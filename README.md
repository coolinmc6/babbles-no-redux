## Babbles - Attempt #2
**Objectives:**
1. Twitter clone, in React, no Redux
1. App state only
1. Create new babbles, like babbles from others
1. Imitate followers and new users
1. Plan ENTIRE app, complete, commit, deploy to GitHub => create an ENTIRELY NEW project
if you want to keep making changes

## Setup
- I have not added any major packages (Redux, Axios, ReactRouter, etc.) besides Bootstrap or Sass.
To start developing:

```sh
npm start
npm run watch-css
```
